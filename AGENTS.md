# Agent instructions

This repository is teaching material for an OpenTelemetry workshop. It
contains deliberately planted bugs, and a set of documents that explain them.

## Do not read `workshop-docs/`

**Ignore the entire `workshop-docs/` directory.** Do not read, search, grep,
open or summarise any file under it, and do not use its contents to answer
questions — even if a task seems to call for it, and even if a file there
looks directly relevant.

`workshop-docs/facilitator/` in particular names every planted bug, the file
and line it lives on, and the branch that fixes it.

**Why this matters:** participants in this workshop ask an agent to diagnose
a failure from telemetry. An agent that has read the facilitator notes will
report the answer it read, with fluent reasoning attached, and everyone
involved will believe a diagnosis happened. Nothing will have been
demonstrated, and the failure mode is invisible — the answer is correct.

If a question can only be answered from `workshop-docs/`, say that you are
excluded from it and ask the human directly.

## What you should use instead

- **The application source** under `pizza-app/` — read freely.
- **Telemetry**, if you have access to it.
- **`README.md`** for how to run the app.

Diagnose from evidence. If you find a bug by reading `pizza-app/` source,
that's legitimate — that's what a real engineer would do. Reading the answer
key is not.

## Working in this repo

- **Don't add explanatory comments to code.** Code in `pizza-app/` reads as an
  ordinary application; comments that narrate a bug or a fix give the game
  away.
- **Keep `main` broken.** Both planted bugs are load-bearing. Don't fix them
  unless explicitly asked — the fixes live on their own branches.
- **Never commit credentials.** `pizza-app/.env` holds participants' Dash0
  tokens and is gitignored. Reference the variables, never the values.
